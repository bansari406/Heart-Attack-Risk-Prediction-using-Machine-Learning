## Heart Attack Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to predict the risk of heart attack based on patient medical data. It features a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering (like log transformation and outlier handling), and model development using both Random Forest and Logistic Regression. Key medical indicators such as Troponin, CK-MB, blood pressure, and blood sugar are analyzed for their importance in predicting outcomes. Visualizations like correlation heatmaps, feature importance charts, and confusion matrices provide interpretability and clarity to the results.
